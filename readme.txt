How to “cheat” in this game>
Cheating concerning for now time only and the player need  to press “M” to increase the time of his round and it will increase time (+2000,every press).

Changes from previous paper prototype: We choose to develop a game prototype from our main idea “City Cleaner” but we rename it “Trash Challenger”. In fact, it allows us to implement features not far from those we initially want to have.  It could be considered as a game in its own right in case we don't achieve the exact functionality desired for “city cleaner”. The core mechanics/ideas still largely the same, in other hand we update the challenge to achieve simple solutions first of all and to look for fun while playing the game.

Overview of game “Trash Challenger”>
In this game, the player will destroy the food to increase his life. We initialize the time from (1000), it will decrease every (10). If the player destroys one object he will get time(+100). At the beginning of the game, the player will face some challenges to explore more food which he needs to destroy to survive in the city and if the player destroys all the food then he will win in this game. They are some effects of particle that reassure the player that the place has many food.
